# What is a script and how do I create one?

  _A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal._
   * _Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions._  
   * _Computers approach tasks in a differrent way than human, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically._  
   * _To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help)._  
   
   
# Expressions
 _An expression evaluate into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions._
  
  1. Expression that just assign a value to a variable.  
  2. Expression that use two or more values to return a single string.  
  
  # Operators  
  _Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create s single value from one or more values._  
  
  1. Assignment Operators
  2. Arithmetic Operators  
  3. String Operators  
  4. Comparison Operators  
  5. Logical Operators  
  
  # What is a function? 
  _Functions lets you group a series of statements together to perform a specific tasks. 
  If different parts of a script repeat the same tasks, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)._
  
  1. Basic Functon 
  2. Declaring a Function  
  3. Calling a Function
