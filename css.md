# What CSS does
  
   * _CSS allows you to create rule that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented_
 
 # How CSS works
 
   * _CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. 
   These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. 
   A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration_
   
 # Rules, Properties and Values
 
   * _Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rules applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like). 
    If there are two or more rules that apply to the same element, it is important to understand which will take precedence_
