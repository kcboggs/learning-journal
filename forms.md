# How forms work

1. A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.  
2. The name of each form control is sent to the sever along with the value the user enters or selects.  
3. The server processes the information using a progreamming language such as PHP, C#, VB.net or java. 
It may also store the information in a database.  
4. The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information recpieved. 

_A form may have several form controls, each gathering different information. The server needs to know which
piece of inputted data corresponds with which form element._
