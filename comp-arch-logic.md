# Binary and Data

Computers run on ones and zeros although no one actually deals directly with ones and zeros they do play a big role 
on how computers work inside. The electric wires inside of the computer carry all the information inside the computer.
The wires in the computer have electricty running through them so the more wires the more bits therefore the complex information
can be represented. The binary number system only has two digits one and zero and each position carries a value which is multiplied by two.

# Circuits and Logic

In order to process the information that comes in as input, and to the imformation that is output a computer needs to modify and combine
the input signals. To accomplish this a computer uses millions of tiny electrical components which come together to form circuits. 
A simple circuit takes an electrical signal and flips it so if you give it a 1 the circuit flips it to 0and vise versa. The signal the goes in isn't the same that goes out therefore making it a "not" circuit.
