# Binary and Data

Computers run on ones and zeros although no one actually deals directly with ones and zeros they do play a big role 
on how computers work inside. The electric wires inside of the computer carry all the information inside the computer.
The wires in the computer have electricty running through them so the more wires the more bits therefore the complex information
can be represented. The binary number system only has two digits one and zero and each position carries a value which is multiplied by two.

# Circuits and Logic

In order to process the information that comes in as input, and to the imformation that is output a computer needs to modify and combine
the input signals. To accomplish this a computer uses millions of tiny electrical components which come together to form circuits. 
A simple circuit takes an electrical signal and flips it so if you give it a 1 the circuit flips it to 0and vise versa. The signal the goes in isn't the same that goes out therefore making it a "not" circuit. More complicated circuits can take multiple signals and combine them, and give you different results. The "and" circuit will only give 1 if the first signal and the second signal are both 1. With logic gates 
there are many small circuits that perform simple logical calculations. By connecting these circuits together you can make more complex circuits that perform more complex calculations. 

# CPU, Memory,Input and Output

All computers do the same four basic things "Input, Store, Process and Output" information which are all done by different parts of the computer. The input devices take the information from the user and convert them into binary information. The memory stores the information
the CPU proccesses and calculates the information and finally the output devices convert the information into a physical output. Computers can take many different types of input example the keyboard or the touchpad of a phone or even a camera. Whatever you iput it is converted into 1's and 0's which is sent as binary from the the CPU calculates how to display your input whether it be an image or text pixel by pixel. Then the CPU requests step by step instructions from the memory which tells it how to draw your output. Then the CPU runs the instructions and stores the results in memory.
