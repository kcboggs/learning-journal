# Binary and Data

Computers run on ones and zeros although no one actually deals directly with ones and zeros they do play a big role 
on how computers work inside. The electric wires inside of the computer carry all the information inside the computer.
The wires in the computer have electricty running through them so the more wires the more bits therefore the complex information
can be represented.
